##Overview

The dnscache module installs, configures and manages the dnscache service.

##Module Description

The dnscache module handles installing, configuring and running dnscache on
Fedora, CentOS/Redhat and Debian/Ubuntu.

##Setup

###What dnscache affects

* dnscache-run / ndjbdns package
* ndjbdns configuration file
* dnscache ENVIRONMENT files
* dnscache service

WARNING: Debian/Ubuntu modifies /etc/resolv.conf to point to 127.0.0.1 which
could pose a problem with DNS if dnscache is not started after the package
is installed.

###Beginning with dnscache

`include '::dnscache'` sets dnscache to listen on $::ipaddress and accept DNS
queries coming from 127.0.0.1. If you want to dnscache to accept DNS queries
from say a local network, then:

```puppet
class { '::dnscache':
  accept_ip => [ '127.0.0.1', '192.168.1' ],
}
```

##Usage

All interaction with the dnscache module can be done through the main dnscache
class. This means you can simply toggle the options in `::dnscache` to have
full functionality of the module.

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here.

osfamily: Debian and Redhat. Defaults to 0.

####`env_mode`

File permissions for dnscache environment files placed in ${dnscache_root}/env
