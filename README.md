## Overview

The dnscache module installs, configures and manages the dnscache service.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juniorsysadmin/puppet-dnscache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juniorsysadmin/puppet-dnscache)

## Module Description

The dnscache module handles installing, configuring and running dnscache on
CentOS/Redhat, Fedora and Ubuntu.

## Setup

### What dnscache affects

* dnscache-run / ndjbdns package
* ndjbdns configuration file
* dnscache environment files
* dnscache service

Note: Ubuntu modifies /etc/resolv.conf to point to 127.0.0.1 which
could pose a problem with DNS if dnscache is not started after the package
is installed.

The Ubuntu version of dnscache also does not support
multiple listen addresses and this module will fail if [listen_ip](#listen_ip)
has more than one value.

This module also does not perform any checks to ensure that the users and
groups used in the provided parameters already exist.

### Beginning with dnscache

`include '::dnscache'` sets dnscache to listen on 127.0.0.1 and accept DNS
queries coming from 127.0.0.1. If you want to dnscache to accept DNS queries
from say a local network, then:

```puppet
class { '::dnscache':
  accept_net => [ '127.0.0.1', '192.168.1' ],
}
```

With CentOS/RedHat you need the epel repository

```puppet
include '::epel'
Class['::epel'] -> Package['dnscache']
```

## Usage

All interaction with the dnscache module can be done through the main dnscache
class. This means you can simply toggle the options in `::dnscache` to have
full functionality of the module.

## Reference

### Classes

#### Public Classes

* dnscache: Main class, includes all other classes.

#### Private Classes

* dnscache::install: Handles the packages.
* dnscache::config: Handles the ndjbdns configuration file and the dnscache
  environment variables
* dnscache::services: Handles the service.

### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the dnscache module:

#### `accept_net`
